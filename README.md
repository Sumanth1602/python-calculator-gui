## Installation
This project requires Python 3. If you don't have Python installed, you can install it from the official website https://www.python.org/.

After installing Python, you also need to have Tkinter and numpy packages installed. If you don't have these installed, you can do it using pip:
```pip install tkinter numpy```

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```git clone https://github.com/username/scientific-calculator.git```


## How to Use
Run the script and a window will pop up with the calculator. You can use it just like a regular calculator, using the buttons on the interface to make calculations.
